## About the project üîé

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

1. Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

### Backend ‚öôÔ∏è

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask server with SQLAlchemy module to simplify the data needs and module for the Auth0 integration for authentication.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend üíª

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
